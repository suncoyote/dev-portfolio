                    <p> I'm currently a professional freelance illustrator and designer based in Tallahasse, FL, transitioning to a career in web development. My extensive freelance background has made me into a self-motivated, versatile problem-solver constantly eager to learn new skills, software and techniques. I have over a decade of experience in making static HTML and CSS websites both as a hobby and for my freelance work, content management systems like Shopify and WordPress, and light experience with PHP. I am comfortable self-hosting and using cPanel.</p>
                    <p>I am currently advancing my skills in JavaScript and Ruby via The Odin Project.</p>

                            <h3>Artwork Portfolio</h3>
                            A clean, simple, mobile-responsive artwork portfolio for my freelance business. This uses a simple PHP script to automatically include files from a directory, allowing for ease of updates, and incorporates JustifiedGallery and LightGallery JavaScript to display images in an appealing and functional way.

                            Running on Shopify, this has been a cornerstone of my online business for over 5 years. Over time I have modified the theme with CSS, navigation, and categories to make things clearer for the customer.
